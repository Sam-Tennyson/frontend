        Ans: " Suppose if we don't have concept like callback, then where will setTimeout contain that data which must be executed after certain task. This is a very simple example you can easily relate that thing. When we are working with API in real project. Then in most of the cases we used callback to handle data. Once we fetch all the data from the server without any error only then this callback execute and we can used that data as per our requirements.",
