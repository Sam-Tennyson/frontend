        Ans: "This is how promises work. Once a promise is resolved we go to then part and so on. But we are not noticing that it could lead us to .then .then chain we call it in simple word promise chain. It might become a tedious task for a developer",

        Ans: "Async Await works like promise. Main difference between promise and Async Await is the way they are written in code. In Promise, once promise resolved we move to 'then' part , another resolve another then and so on. First of all Async function returns a promise, and await can only be used with async function, await function waits until that async function return resolved promise.",
