                  JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                  language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having
                  complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).{" "}

                  There are also more advanced server side versions of
                  JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more
                  functionality to a website than downloading files (such as
                  realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a
                  host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
                  be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                  programmatic control over them.

                  JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
                  Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                  such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                  JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                  supplementing it with additional objects.
